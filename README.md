# README

This is a repo for an R-based analysis of non-native species occurrences in the Lower 48 U.S. (including the District of Columbia), also referred to as the Bad Neighbor analysis.  The project uses the Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (BISON) species occurrence database [https://bison.usgs.gov](https://bison.usgs.gov)

## Installation

```
# Make sure the R devtools package is installed
# install.packages("devtools")

# then run
devtools::install_github("usgs-bis/bad-neighbor-invasives")
```

### Get Started

There are several notebooks outlining various aspects of the project.  All of the analysis and results in the notebooks are self-contained and can be generated running the code chunks in the `.Rmd` versions of the notebooks, in the order they are presented within each notebook.

The HTML verisons of the notebooks are pre-rendered versions of the code notebooks with the `.Rmd` extensions.  The results and graphics should already be rendered in the html.  If thatâ€™s not the case, the notebook should be run by running *all* the code chunks (Mac keyboard: option-command-R; windows keyboard: option-control-R).

The notebooks are all meant to stand alone to describe different elements of development or illustrate the analysis.  Thus each notebook can be run without the others and are organized as follows:

1) 1_bap_bad_neighbor_analysis.rmd (.html) documents the overall project and provides a results from the Bad Neighbor analysis for several taxonomic groups.  This notebook should be considered the main notebook;  

2) 2_bap_bad_neighbor_development_notes.Rmd (.html) documents the development of the functions used in the package and provides example input/output.  This notbook should be used for anyone interested in the background of the developent;

3) 3_grouped_species_notes.Rmd (.html) documents the development of informal taxonomic groups like tree/shrub from formal taxonomic Families.

### R Code

This work is R-based.  The **DESCRIPTION** file contains all the information about the R version and library dependencies.

The project is structured in the following directories:  

**R**: the main R source code  
**data**: source data for the project  
**result_csv**: result bad neighbor summaries stored as csv  
**result_json**: result bad neighbor summaries and species lists stored as JSON  
**man**: Rendered documentation for the functions  
**graphics**: Various graphics generated as part of the analysis  
**js**: Some old javascript functions used as reference


## Use Constraints

This analysis package is designed to provide information on a state-by-state basis, and is limited to that scale.  The analysis results and reported non-native species within a given state are only as accurate as the underlying occurrence data provided to the BISON service, and may not fully reflect the distribution of a species.  Please refer to BISON for a list of [data providers](https://bison.usgs.gov/#providers) and information regarding those collections.  The analysis package does not suggest in any way the absolute acccuracy of these data or the results.
